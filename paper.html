<h1>Website Analysis Paper</h1>

<h2>Good website #1</h2> 
    <p>The first good website I decided to analyze was <a link href="http://www.feedmusic.com">Feed Music.</a></p><p> Upon first glance, this website is very unique. There is a moving, galaxy-like figure upon first glance, which I personally really like. The thing that makes this website stand out the most, however, was the scrolling feature. When you scroll on this website, a quote runs through the galaxy image, then the screen changes to another section, with a different color scheme. The color schemes for section are different and convey a different message or emotion. The beginning uses different shades of blue, followed by a white background and bright colors to represent nerves in the brain, etc. This website does a really good job of using the right colors at the right times. There is also a bar at the top of the section that indicates how far into the section the user is. Towards the bottom of the screen, there is a message that says “scroll down” so that the user knows what to do in the case of confusion, since this website is quite unconventional. In the case that the user does not want to go through unique experience of scrolling through the interactive part of the website, there is a menu bar at the top right hand corner of the home page. As for the code, this website uses HTML-5 lots and lots of meta-tags. They use in the form of a separate linked document. The code contained a number of links and div elements as well. The most obvious “little thing” to me was the font choice. The fonts combined with the colors make a huge difference in professionalism and moderness of this website. Overall, I really really enjoyed this website. </p>
    
    
    <h2>Good website #2</h2>
<p>The second good website I decided to analyze was <a link href="https://landing.adobe.com/en/na/products/marketing-cloud/ctir-3108-running-on-experience/index.html">the Adobe digital marketing webiste.</a> </p>
    <p>This website also has the same scrolling feature as Feed Music, but it’s executed differently. Their background color is the same throughout every section. The color is kind of a bright teal, and gives off a playful, relaxed vibe. I think that color, matched with the white font color and menu bar matches really well and makes the site look really clean. A couple of things I like about this website are its use of different fonts and graphic images included. There is one font that looks as if the text was painted on with a paintbrush, which I think looks really fresh and modern, and there is a moving image of a woman running on the home page that I think looks really intense and cool. This website is also really easy to navigate, with the scrolling feature offered as well as a navigation menu to get to their different subdivisions of the site. I think the designers acheieved their goal of trying to make an innovative, modern website that matches the mission of Adobe as a company. Their layout makes perfect sense to me, although I will say that for someone who isn’t as experienced with websites it could be slightly confusing. The code of this website also uses HTML-5. They also use lots and lots of meta-tags, as well as script tags, which I don’t remember learning about. There’s also a link to canonical sheet, which I don’t understand. Overall, the scrolling feature and the layout make this website look awesome.  </p>
    
    
        <h2>Bad Website</h2>
    <p>The bad website I decided to analyze is the <a link href="http://www.roverp6cars.com/?LMCL=sTRMny">Rover p6 car parts website.</a> </p> <p>This website was absolutely horrible.This site is absolutely horrible. Right off the bat the home page is a headache. The menu bar is a series of links surrounded by the same background image of a car over and over again down the whole side of the page, and they aren’t even lined up! The margin size changes halfway down the page. In the middle of the page, there are a series of brightly-colored fonts that flash, like lime green, bright purple, hot pink, etc to try and get the user’s attention I suppose. Whatever their intention was, it just makes the site look unprofessional. Also down the middle are a series of random images with captions all containing different fonts and random information that does NOT look good at all. The only consistent color is the background color of grey. The fonts and images look outdated. I don’t even know how to use the navigation bar, and there are more links than i can count on my fingers and toes which is just unnecessary. As for the code, it’s written in HTML-5, which is good. But, there is WAY too much code that is repeated and just changed one thing, so it was obviously coded very poorly. Overall, this website was poorly designed, poorly coded, and poorly executed. </p>
