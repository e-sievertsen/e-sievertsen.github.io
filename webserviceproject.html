<title>Web Hosting Provider Review</title>
<h1>Web Hosting Provider Review</h1>

<h2><a href="http://godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a></h2>
<p>For my first web hosting provider, I decided to research godaddy.com. Their website classifies their package offerings based on the domain name. The cheapest option is a domain with the suffix .site, starting at $.99/year for the first year. Another package they offer is the .life domain, starting at $3.99/year for the first year. They also offer a ".biz" domain for $7.99/year, and a .org domain for $9.99/year. Godaddy gives a small bit of information and recommendations on which domain name to use for your given purpose. The godaddy website seems to be more targeted toward the common web user as opposed to someone who understands the complexities of web design.  </p>

<h2><a href="http://hostgator.com">hostgator.com</a></h2>
<p>The second web service provider I researched was hostgator.com. Their set-up was a different than godaddy; they separated their plans based on the number of domains given and other services provided.E Each category has a set of plans. Their cheapest set of plans plan comes with one domain name and basic website building tools, for $3.84/month. There are a couple intermediate options in between, then their most expensive plans come with unlimited domains, total control over production, extra storage, and unmetered bandwidth. That plan can cost up to $148/month. The layout of this websiteis a little more convoluted than godaddy, and is definitely geared more towards someone who understands computer science.</p>

<h2><a href="http://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a></h2>

<p>The third and final website I researched was bluehost.com. Upon first glance, the layout of this website is the most accessible and professional out of the three I researched. This website has a plan package that is much more generalized. They provide a plan with a few basic tools, then options to expand or add on to the plan. There is also accessibility to WordPress through this website. The plan starting cost is $3.95/month. Bluehost was my favorite website of the three. The color scheme was professional and sleek, the visual devices made it interactive, and the options for domain and hosting services were made very clear. Althoguh the target customer may be someone who is educated in hosting services, the website is still very easy to navigate.</p>
