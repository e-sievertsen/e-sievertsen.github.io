        <p>Hello! Welcome to your local how to adopt a dog page. This website will tell you a little bit about why you should adopt a dog and how you should do it! If you are considering adopting a dog, this is the page for you.</p>
            <p>When considering whether or not to adopt a dog, it is important to consider several different factors. Some of these factors may include: what kind of dog you're looking for; your willingness to deal with an animal that may require extra attention or have specific needs; the needs of other people who will be contributing to taking care of the dog; finances; and logistics. A good resource to use if these questions are ones you're looking to answer is the "Pros and Cons for Dummies" page for adopting a shelter dog. </p>
        <p> Once you have decided to adopt a dog, it's important to know a little bit about what you want before you show up to an adoption center. The link titled "Pedigree Dog Breed Quiz" will help you narrow down your search in terms of what kind of dog you'll be looking for when you show up. </p>
        <p> Lastly, the other two links are links to websites for local adoption centers here in Helena! The first is a PetSmart that has an adoption center built in to it. So, you could adopt a dog while grabbing some food for another pet! The other link is for the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane Society. The Humane Society is purely an adoption center, with employees there to help you with finances and logistics of adopting a dog. If you want to adopt a dog in Helena, head on over to one of these places!</p>
        
        <p>Now that you know a little more about how to go about adopting a dog here in town, I hope you consider adopting one of the little guys or gals looking for a home!!</p>
