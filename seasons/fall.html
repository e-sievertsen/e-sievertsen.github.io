        <p>Hello! Welcome to the fall for the seasons of Fall! Here at Fall, we are warm, cozy, and calming! Here's some information about Fall according to Wikipedia!</p> 
        <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. One of its main features in temperate climates is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.</p>
