        <p>Hello! Welcome to the Summer page! Here at Summer, we are colorful, fun, and exciting! Here is some information about our season according to Wikipedia!Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. </p>
