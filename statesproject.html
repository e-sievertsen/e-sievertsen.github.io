<h1>States Analysis Project</h1>

<h2><a href="http://az.gov">1. Arizona</a></h2>
<p> Out of all the websites I researched, my favorite was the state of Arizona. The layout of the website was very appealing and aesthically pleasing. The first thing I checked for was whether or not the website was made to adjust to the window size, in other words, if the website was responsive, and it was! The background picture of the home page had a good contrast of bright and neutral colors, and made the text on the page pop. Also, the fonts used were simple and modern, making the website the perfect mixture between professionable and personable.</p>

<h2><a href="http://nebraska.gov">2. Nebraska</a></h2>
<p>I ranked the Nebraska website second because of it's sleek, modernized style, and accessibility. The links are lined up very nicely and makes it easy for the common user to get around the website. Although not quite up to the standard of Arizona's website, Nebraska was also able to effectively create a website with accessible links, a clean layout, and a nice color scheme. </p>

<h2><a href="http://nh.gov">3. New Hampshire</a></h2>
<p> The New Hampshire website is responsive, and looks professional. The links are easily accessible, the colors are neutral and easy on the eyes, and the website is responsive. This website's ranking of #3 is quite fitting: middle of the road, not great but not bad, largely just existing. The layout of the website is somewhat efficient and is not difficult to navigate, but the search bar is in a weird place and the font is not very pleasing. </p>
<h2><a href="http://montana.gov">4.Montana</a></h2>
<p>I ranked the Montana state website #4. This website was a little convoluted in the way it laid out its directory and current news;the only thing really easy to navigate was the top link area. The color scheme was nothing special, and the font was a little too bold for how small the font size was. Overall, the Montana website was largely anticlimatic with no real appeal.</p>
<h2><a href="http://alaska.gov">5. Alaska</a></h2>
<p>I ranked Alaska's website #5, mostly because the site isn't responsive: the alignment doesn't change at all when the window size changes, so for people looking at the website on their phones, the website is much harder to navigate. The colors are also not very friendly, and the fonts look outdated. It gets the job done, but not in an efficient or aesthetic manner.</p>
